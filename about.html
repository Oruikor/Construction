        <span> A school is an educational institution design to provide learning space and learning environments for the teaching of students (or “pupils”) under the directions of teachers. The ultimate aim of education/teaching and learning is to cause change in behavior of a learner. A teacher is a person who assists others in gaining knowledge, value and competence. Religious Education (RE) is a subject taught at primary and secondary levels that aims to develop children's understanding of the world's religions. Through religious education, children will learn about different religions and their traditions, practices and beliefs. 
        The fundamental ideology of Christianity is based on the belief of Jesus Christ as the son of God and the fore seen Messiah. The word Messiah originated from the Hebrew word meaning „anointed one‟.</span>
